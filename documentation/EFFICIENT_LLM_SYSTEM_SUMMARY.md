| **DistilBERT** | 66MB | Very Low | Very Fast | Sentiment analysis |
| **DialoGPT Small** | 117MB | Low | Fast | Trading decisions |
| **DistilGPT-2** | 82MB | Very Low | Very Fast | Text generation |
| **FinBERT Tone** | 440MB | Low | Fast | Financial sentiment |

## 🎯 Recommended Models for Your System

Based on your **AMD Ryzen 7 5700X** with **32GB RAM**:

### **Primary Recommendation: FinBERT Tone**
- **Size**: 440MB (vs 4GB+ for LLaMA)
- **CPU Usage**: Low (no more 100% spikes)
- **Speed**: Fast (financial-specific)
- **Use Case**: Perfect for trading sentiment analysis

### **Fallback Options**:
1. **DistilBERT** (66MB) - Ultra-lightweight for basic tasks
2. **DialoGPT Small** (117MB) - Good for trading decisions
3. **DistilGPT-2** (82MB) - Fast text generation
